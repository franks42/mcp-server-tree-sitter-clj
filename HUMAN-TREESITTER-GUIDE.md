## üìã What to Ask AI Assistants

### üó∫Ô∏è Codebase Discovery and Architecture

**When you need to understand a new or complex codebase:**

**Ask AI:** *"Analyze the structure and architecture of this project using tree-sitter. What are the main components and how do they relate?"*

**What AI will do:**
```python
# AI first gets server context (new essential step!)
context = mcp__tree_sitter__get_treesitter_context()

# AI registers your project and analyzes structure
project_analysis = mcp__tree_sitter__analyze_project(
    project="your-project", scan_depth=3
)

# Maps file organization and identifies key modules
key_files = mcp__tree_sitter__list_files(
    project="your-project", pattern="**/*.py"
)

# Analyzes symbols in important files
symbols = mcp__tree_sitter__get_symbols(
    project="your-project", file_path="src/main.py",
    symbol_types=["functions", "classes", "imports"]
)
```

**You'll get:**

## üí¨ Sample Conversations with AI

### Conversation 1: Understanding Legacy Code

**You:** "I inherited this Python project and I'm completely lost. Can you help me understand what it does?"

**AI Response:** "I'll analyze the project structure for you. Let me start with a high-level overview..."

*[AI performs project analysis using tree-sitter tools]*

**AI:** "This appears to be a data processing pipeline with 3 main components:

1. **Data Ingestion** (`src/ingestion/`) - 5 modules handling different data sources
2. **Processing Core** (`src/processors/`) - Main business logic in 12 modules
3. **Output Handlers** (`src/outputs/`) - 4 different output formats

The main entry point is `main.py` which orchestrates the pipeline. The most complex module is `processors/data_transformer.py` (complexity score: 15.2 - needs attention).

Key dependencies: pandas, sqlalchemy, redis
Main data flow: Raw data ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Transformation ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí Output

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific component?"

### Conversation 2: Refactoring Planning

**You:** "The `calculate_metrics` function in analytics.py is getting too complex. I want to break it down but I'm worried about breaking things."

**AI Response:** "Let me analyze the impact of refactoring `calculate_metrics`..."

*[AI performs comprehensive impact analysis]*

**AI:** "I found `calculate_metrics` is used in 8 locations across 5 files. Here's the breakdown:

**High Risk Changes:**
- `reports/monthly.py:45` - Passes complex parameters, signature change would break this
- `api/endpoints.py:123` - Called from external API, needs backward compatibility

**Low Risk Changes:**
- `tests/test_analytics.py` - 4 test cases, easy to update

**Refactoring Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1**: Extract helper functions (no breaking changes)
   - `_calculate_averages()` - lines 15-30
   - `_apply_filters()` - lines 35-50
   
2. **Phase 2**: Create new interface, deprecate old
   - Keep original function for backward compatibility
   - Add warning about deprecation
   
3. **Phase 3**: Update all callers and remove old function

**Complexity Reduction**: Current complexity 18.5 ‚Üí Expected 6.2 after refactoring

Would you like me to show you the specific code patterns to extract?"

### Conversation 3: Architecture Review

**You:** "Can you review the architecture of this microservice? I'm concerned about the dependencies and coupling."

**AI Response:** "I'll analyze the architecture and dependency patterns..."

*[AI performs comprehensive architecture analysis]*

**AI:** "**Architecture Analysis Results:**

**üü¢ Good Patterns:**
- Clear separation between handlers, services, and repositories
- Proper dependency injection in most modules
- Consistent error handling patterns

**üü° Concerns:**
- **Circular Dependencies**: Found 3 circular import chains:
  - `models.py` ‚Üî `validators.py` ‚Üî `utils.py`
  - `auth/service.py` ‚Üî `user/service.py`
  
- **High Coupling**: `core/business_logic.py` imports from 12 different modules

**üî¥ Issues:**
- Database models imported directly in API handlers (should go through services)
- Configuration scattered across 8 different files

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Break circular dependencies** by extracting interfaces
2. **Reduce coupling** in business_logic.py - split into 3 focused modules
3. **Centralize configuration** - create single config module

**Priority**: Address circular dependencies first (deployment risk), then tackle coupling.

Would you like me to show specific refactoring steps for any of these issues?"
